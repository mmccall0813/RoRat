# RoRat

A remote management web interface for Roblox. Requires a LUA executor (exploit) such as [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to/), [ScriptWare](https://script-ware.com), or [KRNL](https://krnl.vip/)

## Why?

This project is made for convenience to manage any Roblox games you have open.
Say you want to check on your autofarm and make sure its still running but you don't have access to your computer.
You can use RoRat to check on your game from anywhere as long as you have access to your web interface.

## How do I use it?

You will need
  - Git SCM for windows (git)
  - Node.js

First, you need to locally clone the Github repo to copy the code to your machine. Run these commands in the folder you want the code to be:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmccall0813/RoRat.git
```

cd into the directory

```
cd RoRat
```

install dependencies and run server

```
npm i
npm run start
```

then open roblox and run the script in the client folder
